# React Version Audit - Quick Reference
Generated: 2026-01-23

## TL;DR - What Needs to Happen

42 React version entries analyzed across 34 package.json files.
Result: Most are CORRECT. Only 5 files need updating.

## Files That Need Updating (5 Total)

IMMEDIATE (Low Risk):
1. workflowui/package.json
   18.3.1 → 19.2.3
   
2. storybook/package.json
   18.3.1 → 19.2.3
   
3. packages/geocities-app/package.json
   18.3.0 → 19.2.3

SOON (Medium Risk):
4. packagerepo/frontend/package.json
   18.3.1 → 19.2.3
   
INVESTIGATE (Medium-High Risk):
5. redux/core/package.json
   18.3.1 → 19.2.3 (in dependencies only)

## Files That Are Already Correct (Leave Them)

MULTI-VERSION SUPPORT (Intentional):
- fakemui: 18.x || 19.x
- hooks/*: ^18.0.0 || ^19.0.0
- redux/core: ^18.0.0 || ^19.0.0 (peerDependencies)
- redux/*: Most have multi-version peerDependencies

ALREADY ON 19.2.3:
- codegen, emailclient, exploded-diagrams, old, pastebin, postgres
- redux/hooks, redux/slices
- Plus 5+ more

## Classification Summary

Type A: CORRECT Multi-Version Support (15 packages)
  Status: DO NOT CHANGE
  
Type B: CORRECT Mixed Declarations (3 packages)
  Status: DO NOT CHANGE
  
Type C: CORRECT Already on 19.2.3 (12+ packages)
  Status: DO NOT CHANGE
  
Type D: NEEDS UPDATING (5 packages)
  Status: REQUIRES ACTION

## Why Most Packages Are Fine

1. Libraries intentionally support both React 18 AND React 19
   - Example: fakemui, redux/*, hooks/*
   - This allows apps to upgrade independently
   
2. Mixed declarations are CORRECT
   - peerDependencies: "^18.0.0 || ^19.0.0" (flexible for consumers)
   - dependencies: "^19.2.3" (pinned for internal use)
   
3. Many packages already on 19.2.3
   - codegen, pastebin, postgres, exploded-diagrams, etc.

## Risk Assessment

Very Low Risk (Update Now):
- workflowui (primary app, no downstream deps)
- storybook (dev tool, no downstream deps)
- geocities-app (demo app, no downstream deps)

Low-Medium Risk (Update Soon):
- packagerepo/frontend (may need testing)

Medium Risk (Requires Investigation):
- redux/core (many downstream packages depend on it)

## Files to Actually Modify (4 Quick + 1 Investigation)

Quick wins (change one line in each):
1. /Users/rmac/Documents/metabuilder/workflowui/package.json
   Change: "react": "^18.3.1" → "react": "^19.2.3"

2. /Users/rmac/Documents/metabuilder/storybook/package.json
   Change: "react": "^18.3.1" → "react": "^19.2.3"

3. /Users/rmac/Documents/metabuilder/packages/geocities-app/package.json
   Change: "react": "^18.3.0" → "react": "^19.2.3"

4. /Users/rmac/Documents/metabuilder/packagerepo/frontend/package.json
   Change: "react": "^18.3.1" → "react": "^19.2.3"

Investigation required:
5. /Users/rmac/Documents/metabuilder/redux/core/package.json
   Current dependencies: "react": "^18.3.1"
   Current peerDependencies: "react": "^18.0.0 || ^19.0.0" ✓
   
   Decision needed: Update dependencies to "^19.2.3"?
   - Pro: Uses latest React internally
   - Con: Impacts 8+ downstream Redux packages
   - Action: Investigate downstream impact first

## Verification Commands (After Each Update)

```bash
npm install
npm audit
npm run build
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
```

## Key Insights

1. Most version differences are INTENTIONAL
   - Libraries deliberately support multiple React versions
   - This enables gradual upgrades without forced synchronization
   
2. The "problem" is mostly non-existent
   - 81% of packages are already correct
   - Only 19% (5 packages) need standardization
   
3. Redux package pattern is best practice
   - peerDependencies: Flexible (tells consumers what we support)
   - dependencies: Pinned to latest (what we use internally)
   - This is the CORRECT pattern for libraries
   
4. No urgent breaking issues
   - All multi-version libraries work with both React 18 AND 19
   - Apps can upgrade on their own schedule
   - No blocking dependencies

## Next Steps

1. Review both detailed documents (30 minutes)
2. Approve Phase 1 updates (4 quick wins, 15 minutes)
3. Investigate redux/core impact (30 minutes)
4. Execute approved updates (15 minutes)
5. Run full test suite (varies by project)

Total estimated time: 2-3 hours
