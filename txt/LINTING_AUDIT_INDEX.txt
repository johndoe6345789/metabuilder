## THREE-DOCUMENT BREAKDOWN

### 1. LINTING_TOOLS_SUMMARY.txt (START HERE!)

   Contains:
     - What's the problem? (executive summary)
     - Quick stats (ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript versions)
     - Critical vs Important vs Nice-to-have fixes
     - Standardization targets
     - Files that need updates
     - Time estimate: 1.5-2 hours total

   READ THIS FIRST for immediate understanding

### 2. LINTING_DETAILED_BREAKDOWN.txt (FOR PLANNING)
   Status: Project-by-project Analysis
   Size: ~6 KB
   Best For: Understanding each project's status, impact analysis
   Contains:
     - All 11+ projects analyzed (dbal, frontends, workflow, redis, postgres, etc.)
     - Status per project (compliance score: X/4)
     - Severity classification (CRITICAL → LOW PRIORITY)
     - Impact analysis by project type
     - Redux ecosystem analysis
     - Workflow plugins analysis
     - What each project is missing

   USE THIS for detailed planning and project prioritization

### 3. LINTING_TOOLS_AUDIT_2026-01-23.txt (FOR EXECUTION)
   Status: Comprehensive Reference
   Size: ~10 KB
   Best For: Implementation details, standardization roadmap
   Contains:
     - Full ESLint versions breakdown (5 different versions found)
     - @eslint/js versions breakdown (3 different versions)
     - Prettier status (only 2 projects have it!)
     - All 7 ESLint plugins with versions
     - All TypeScript versions (6 different ranges)
     - Problematic versions identified (beta, deprecated, too loose)
     - Detailed standardization roadmap (5 PHASES)
     - Consistency matrix (all projects vs all tools)
     - Critical issues prioritization

   USE THIS for implementing fixes and reference during execution

## KEY FINDINGS AT A GLANCE

### Most Critical Issues (MUST FIX):
1. workflowui: MISSING ESLint entirely
2. 9 projects: MISSING Prettier (should have ^3.4.2)
3. 4 projects: OLD ESLint versions (^8.0.0, ^8 instead of ^9.39.2)

### Major Inconsistencies:
- ESLint versions: ^8.0.0, ^8, ^9.28.0, ^9.39.2 (4 different versions!)
- TypeScript versions: 6 different version ranges
- ESLint plugins: Major version mismatches (react-hooks ^5.2.0 vs ^7.0.1)

### Project Compliance Scores:
- frontends/nextjs ..................... 4/4 ✅ BEST
- dbal/development ..................... 3/4 ✓ GOOD
- codegen, old ........................ 3.5/4 ✓ GOOD
- workflowui .......................... 1/4 ❌ CRITICAL (NO ESLINT)
- workflow, pastebin ................. 0.5-1/4 ❌ POOR

## STANDARDIZATION TARGETS (From LINTING_TOOLS_AUDIT)

Phase 1: ESLint & @eslint/js
  └─ Target: eslint: ^9.39.2, @eslint/js: ^9.39.2
     Files: 4 projects need updates
     Effort: 15-20 minutes

Phase 2: Add Missing Prettier
  └─ Target: prettier: ^3.4.2
     Files: 9 projects need this added
     Effort: 10-15 minutes

Phase 3: ESLint Plugin Standardization
  └─ Complex: Requires testing
     Key issue: react-hooks has 2 major versions in use
     Effort: 20-30 minutes

Phase 4: TypeScript Standardization
  └─ Target: typescript: ^5.9.3
     Files: 12+ projects need updates
     Effort: 30-45 minutes

Phase 5: Add ESLint to Missing Projects
  └─ Target: Add eslint: ^9.39.2 to projects without it
     Files: workflowui and others
     Effort: 5-10 minutes

## STATISTICS

Projects Audited:
  - Main projects: 11 (dbal, frontends, workflow, codegen, postgres, etc.)
  - Redux packages: 11 (slices, hooks, adapters, etc.)
  - Workflow plugins: 11 (all TS plugins)
  - Other packages: 3+ (storybook, pastebin, exploded-diagrams, etc.)

ESLint Distribution:

  - ^9.28.0: 1 project (OUTDATED)
  - ^8.0.0: 1 project (DEPRECATED)
  - ^8: 1 project (DEPRECATED)
  - MISSING: 1 project (workflowui - CRITICAL)

Prettier Distribution:
  - ^3.4.2: 2 projects (GOOD)
  - MISSING: 9 projects ⚠️

TypeScript Distribution:
  - ^5.9.3: 10 projects (STANDARD)
  - ~5.9.3: 4 projects (strict patch, acceptable)
  - ^5.0.0: 12+ projects (TOO LOOSE)
  - ^5.3.3: 2 projects (outdated range)
  - ^5: 2+ projects (too loose)
  - 5.9.3: 1 project (exact, fine)

## HOW TO USE THESE DOCUMENTS

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
  → Read: LINTING_TOOLS_SUMMARY.txt (5 minutes)
  → You'll understand what's broken and why it matters

### Step 2: Plan Your Approach
  → Read: LINTING_DETAILED_BREAKDOWN.txt (10-15 minutes)
  → You'll see each project's status and what to fix

### Step 3: Execute the Fix
  → Read: LINTING_TOOLS_AUDIT_2026-01-23.txt (reference during work)
  → Use the 5-phase standardization roadmap
  → Follow the detailed lists of files to update

### Step 4: Verify
  → Run: npm install at project root
  → Run: npm audit
  → Check for new issues

## NEXT ACTIONS (In Order of Priority)

CRITICAL (Do Now):
  1. Add eslint: ^9.39.2 to workflowui/package.json
     Expected time: 2 minutes

HIGH (Do This Week):
  2. Add prettier: ^3.4.2 to 9 projects (see LINTING_DETAILED_BREAKDOWN.txt)
     Expected time: 10-15 minutes

  3. Update ESLint versions in 4 old projects
     Files: workflow, pastebin, emailclient, old/package.json
     Expected time: 5-10 minutes

MEDIUM (Do This Sprint):
  4. Resolve eslint-plugin-react-hooks version conflict (^5.2.0 vs ^7.0.1)
     Expected time: 30+ minutes (requires testing)

  5. Standardize TypeScript versions (6 different ranges → all ^5.9.3)
     Expected time: 30-45 minutes

NICE-TO-HAVE (Do Later):
  6. Update eslint-plugin-tailwindcss from beta (^4.0.0-beta.0) to stable
