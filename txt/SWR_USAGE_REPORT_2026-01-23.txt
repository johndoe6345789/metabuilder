SWR (Stale-While-Revalidate) Dependency Report
===============================================
Generated: 2026-01-23
Status: VERIFIED & COMPATIBLE WITH REACT 19

SUMMARY
=======
SWR is NOT directly declared in any project package.json files.
SWR is a TRANSITIVE DEPENDENCY pulled in by @clerk/nextjs via @clerk/shared.

DEPENDENCY CHAIN
================
postgres/package.json
  └─ @clerk/nextjs@^6.36.6
     └─ @clerk/shared (bundled/internal dependency)
        └─ swr@2.3.4

SWR VERSION DETAILS
===================
Package: swr
Version Installed: 2.3.4
Source: @clerk/shared (internal dependency of @clerk/nextjs)
Location: /postgres/node_modules/swr/

Peer Dependencies (in swr/package.json):
  "react": "^16.11.0 || ^17.0.0 || ^18.0.0 || ^19.0.0"

REACT 19 COMPATIBILITY
======================
✓ FULLY COMPATIBLE

SWR 2.3.4 explicitly supports React 19.0.0+ in its peer dependency range.
The postgres package uses React ^19.2.3, which is within SWR's supported range.

VERSION MATRIX
==============
postgres/package.json:
  "react": "^19.2.3"
  "@clerk/nextjs": "^6.36.6"
    └─ swr: "2.3.4" (via @clerk/shared)

SWR 2.3.4 peer dependency:
  "react": "^16.11.0 || ^17.0.0 || ^18.0.0 || ^19.0.0"

Result: ✓ React 19.2.3 matches ^19.0.0 range

USAGE IN CODEBASE
=================
✓ NOT DIRECTLY USED in any source code
  - No "import useSWR" statements found in source files
  - No "from 'swr'" imports found
  - SWR is purely a transitive dependency

✓ INDIRECTLY USED by @clerk/nextjs
  - @clerk/shared uses SWR internally for data fetching
  - Transparent to application code

CLERK/NEXTJS INTEGRATION
========================
The postgres package uses @clerk/nextjs@^6.36.6 for authentication.
@clerk/nextjs bundles @clerk/shared as an internal dependency.
@clerk/shared uses SWR 2.3.4 for its internal API calls.

This is a normal pattern - the SWR library is "hidden" inside Clerk's package
and handles data fetching for authentication state, user info, etc.

SECURITY STATUS
===============
✓ No known vulnerabilities
✓ Actively maintained (Vercel project)
✓ Compatible with latest React ecosystem

RECOMMENDATIONS
================
1. No action required - SWR is compatible with React 19
2. Continue using @clerk/nextjs@^6.36.6 (latest compatible version)
3. If upgrading @clerk/nextjs in future, verify it includes compatible SWR
4. Current setup in postgres/ is optimal

AFFECTED PROJECTS
=================
✓ postgres/
  - Uses via @clerk/nextjs
  - React: 19.2.3
  - Status: COMPATIBLE

OTHER PROJECTS
==============
workflowui/ - Does NOT use @clerk/nextjs, does NOT have SWR
frontends/nextjs/ - Does NOT use @clerk/nextjs, does NOT have SWR
codegen/ - Does NOT use @clerk/nextjs, does NOT have SWR

NOTES
=====
- SWR is Vercel's lightweight data fetching library
- Commonly used by auth providers for token refresh and user state
- The 2.3.4 version is recent (2024) and well-supported
- React 19 support was added in SWR 2.2.0+, confirmed in 2.3.4
