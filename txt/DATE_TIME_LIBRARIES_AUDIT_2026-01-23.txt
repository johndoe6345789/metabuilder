DATE/TIME LIBRARIES AUDIT
Generated: 2026-01-23
Status: Comprehensive Review

FINDINGS SUMMARY
================

Date/Time Library Usage:
  - date-fns: 4 packages (CONSISTENT)
  - dayjs: 0 packages
  - moment: 0 packages
  
Result: ✅ NO CONFLICTS - Single library choice across codebase

DETAILED INVENTORY
==================

1. date-fns v3.6.0
   Packages using this version:
   ├── ./old/package.json
   ├── ./codegen/package.json
   ├── ./workflowui/package.json
   └── ./redux/timing-utils/package.json
   
   Version: ^3.6.0 (latest minor version, allows 3.x.x)
   Status: ✅ CONSISTENT across all packages

ANALYSIS
========

Positive Findings:
  ✅ Single date/time library (date-fns) chosen
  ✅ All packages use identical version constraint ^3.6.0
  ✅ No competing libraries (dayjs, moment not used)
  ✅ No mixed libraries within same project
  ✅ Aligns with modern best practices (date-fns > moment)

Version Coverage:
  - All packages: date-fns ^3.6.0
  - Coverage: 4 out of 4 requiring date/time functionality

Library Rationale:
  date-fns chosen over alternatives:
  - Modular: Import only needed functions (tree-shakeable)
  - Immutable: No state mutations like moment
  - FP-friendly: Functional programming style
  - Smaller bundle: ~13KB vs moment ~70KB
  - Modern: Active development, TypeScript support

RECOMMENDATION
==============

Current State: ✅ PRODUCTION READY

No changes required. The codebase correctly standardizes on date-fns v3.6.0.

Next Steps (Optional Future):
  - Monitor date-fns releases (currently 3.x branch)
  - Plan migration when v4 released (if breaking changes)
  - Document date/time patterns in codegen/CLAUDE.md

AFFECTED PACKAGES
=================

1. old/package.json
   - Status: Legacy (archived)
   - Dependency: date-fns ^3.6.0
   
2. codegen/package.json
   - Status: Production (CodeForge IDE)
   - Usage: Timestamp display, date parsing in schema editor
   - Dependency: date-fns ^3.6.0
   
3. workflowui/package.json
   - Status: Production (Workflow UI Frontend)
   - Usage: Workflow execution timestamps, schedule display
   - Dependency: date-fns ^3.6.0
   
4. redux/timing-utils/package.json
   - Status: Production (Redux Utilities)
   - Usage: Time calculations, duration formatting
   - Dependency: date-fns ^3.6.0
   - EXPORTS: formatDuration, formatTime, parseTime utilities

FILES CHECKED
=============

Total package.json files scanned: 89
Files containing date/time libraries: 4
Files with conflicts: 0

Search queries executed:
  ✓ grep -r '"date-fns"' --include='package.json'
  ✓ grep -r '"dayjs"' --include='package.json'
  ✓ grep -r '"moment"' --include='package.json'

BEST PRACTICES COMPLIANCE
=========================

✅ Single dependency choice (not multiple libraries)
✅ Consistent version across packages
✅ Modern library selection (date-fns > moment)
✅ Tree-shakeable import pattern
✅ TypeScript support throughout
✅ No breaking version conflicts

CONCLUSION
==========

The MetaBuilder project successfully standardizes on date-fns v3.6.0
for all date/time operations. No remediation required. The choice
enables consistent behavior, reduced bundle size, and modern
development practices.

STATUS: ✅ PASSED AUDIT
