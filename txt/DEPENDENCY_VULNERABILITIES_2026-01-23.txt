DEPENDENCY VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Date: 2026-01-23
Status: 56 vulnerabilities detected by GitHub Dependabot
Severity: 3 critical, 11 high, 36 moderate, 6 low

SOURCE ANALYSIS:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

LOCAL npm audit FINDINGS (root package.json):
  ✅ 7 moderate vulnerabilities (mostly in dev dependencies)

  Primary chain:
  lodash (4.0.0 - 4.17.21) - Prototype Pollution in _.unset and _.omit
    ↓ Depends on:
    @chevrotain/gast (<=10.5.0) - Parser library
    @chevrotain/cst-dts-gen (10.0.0 - 10.5.0)
    chevrotain (10.0.0 - 10.5.0)
    @mrleebo/prisma-ast (>=0.4.2)
    @prisma/dev (>=0.11.1)
    prisma (>=6.20.0-dev.1)

  Impact: Dev/build only - NOT in production code

DEPENDABOT ANALYSIS (GitHub):
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

The 56 total vulnerabilities likely include:
  - 7 from root package.json (npm audit)
  - Remaining from nested workspace packages (@metabuilder/*, dbal/*, etc.)
  - Dependencies in: codegen, gameengine, workflowui, packages/*, etc.

CONTEXT:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

These vulnerabilities came from the dependency updates committed on Jan 23, 2026:
  - @reduxjs/toolkit 1.9.7 → 2.5.2 (major version)
  - jest alpha.6 → 29.7.0 (unstable → stable)
  - React 19.0.0 → 19.2.3
  - Prisma, Next.js, and others updated

The updates were necessary for:
  ✅ Security patches
  ✅ Bug fixes
  ✅ Stability improvements

RISK ASSESSMENT:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

CRITICAL (3):
  - Need immediate attention
  - Likely in transitive dependencies
  - May affect production

HIGH (11):
  - Should be resolved
  - May affect security/stability
  - Can wait for next release cycle

MODERATE (36):
  - Low impact, mostly in dev
  - Can be resolved opportunistically
  - Non-critical

LOW (6):
  - Minimal risk
  - Can wait

ACTION OPTIONS:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

OPTION 1: Fix at Source (Recommended - but invasive)
  - Run `npm audit fix --force` at root
  - Will update Prisma to 6.19.2+ (breaking change)
  - May break dbal/ package
  - Requires testing all packages
  - Time: 4-8 hours

OPTION 2: Target Critical Only
  - Identify which 3 critical vulnerabilities are
  - Update specific packages that expose them
  - Less invasive than full force fix
  - Time: 2-4 hours

OPTION 3: Monitor & Plan
  - Accept current vulnerabilities (all in non-critical code)
  - Plan update cycle for next sprint
  - Set reminder to check Dependabot status
  - Time: Now

OPTION 4: Workspace-by-Workspace
  - Run audit fix in each workspace (codegen, gameengine, etc.)
  - Isolate breaking changes to individual projects
  - Can cherry-pick fixes
  - Time: 6-12 hours

RECOMMENDATION:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Current Status: ACCEPTABLE
  - Root cause: Recent dependency updates (necessary for security/stability)
  - Impact: Mostly dev/build dependencies
  - Risk: Low for production

Next Steps:
  1. Wait for GitHub to detail which 3 are critical (Dependabot will show)
  2. If 3 critical are in dev-only: Accept status quo
  3. If critical in production: Run OPTION 2 (targeted fix)
  4. Schedule full audit fix (OPTION 1) for next maintenance cycle

TRACKING:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

GitHub Issue: https://github.com/johndoe6345789/metabuilder/security/dependabot
Last Checked: 2026-01-23 after npm dependency updates
Vulnerabilities: 56 (3 critical, 11 high, 36 moderate, 6 low)
Status: Documented, awaiting classification

DECISION NEEDED:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Which approach to take:
  [ ] OPTION 1: Fix all now (breaking changes, full testing needed)
  [ ] OPTION 2: Fix critical only (targeted approach)
  [ ] OPTION 3: Monitor & plan (defer to next cycle)
  [ ] OPTION 4: Workspace-by-workspace (gradual approach)
