@tanstack/react-query Version Audit
Date: 2026-01-23
Status: COMPLETE - NO ACTION REQUIRED

OBJECTIVE
---------
Search for all @tanstack/react-query versions across the codebase and update any found
to ^5.90.20 (minimum version established in CLAUDE.md dependency management).

METHODOLOGY
-----------
1. Searched all package.json files (excluding node_modules) for "@tanstack/react-query"
2. Searched for import statements using @tanstack/react-query in source code
3. Checked root package.json and key workspace packages
4. Verified devDependencies and peerDependencies

FINDINGS
--------
✅ RESULT: NO @tanstack/react-query dependencies found in any source package.json files

Scope Checked:
- Root package.json: NOT PRESENT
- workflowui/package.json: NOT PRESENT
- codegen/package.json: NOT PRESENT
- frontends/nextjs/package.json: NOT PRESENT
- postgres/package.json: NOT PRESENT
- pastebin/package.json: NOT PRESENT
- All other workspace packages: NOT PRESENT
- Source code imports (*.ts, *.tsx, *.js, *.jsx): NO IMPORTS FOUND

Note: @tanstack/react-query v5.72.2 exists in node_modules as a transitive dependency
of @prisma/studio-core, but is NOT directly used by the codebase.

CONCLUSION
----------
✅ NO ACTION REQUIRED
- The codebase does not directly depend on @tanstack/react-query
- No versions need updating
- No version conflicts to resolve
- Transitive dependency from Prisma is acceptable

RECOMMENDATION
--------------
If @tanstack/react-query is needed in the future for data fetching/caching:
1. Install explicitly in the appropriate workspace(s)
2. Use version ^5.90.20 or later
3. Update CLAUDE.md dependency table if added
