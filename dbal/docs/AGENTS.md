# ⚠️ AGENTS.md has moved

This file has been moved to the project root for better discoverability and expanded to cover the entire MetaBuilder project (not just DBAL).

**New location:** `/AGENTS.md` (project root)

**What AGENTS.md covers:**
- Core principles (95% config rule, schema-first development, one lambda per file, multi-tenant safety, ACL-first)
- DBAL development (Phase 2 TypeScript, Phase 3 C++, API contract model, file organization)
- Frontend development (Next.js patterns, DBAL integration, project structure)
- Package development (JSON-based UI, metadata structure, development workflow)
- Testing strategy (Unit, Integration, E2E testing)
- Deployment guidelines (development, production, schema management)
- Troubleshooting (common errors and solutions)
- Best practices and quick reference

**Quick Navigation:**
- **For all agents:** `/AGENTS.md` (START HERE)
- **Comprehensive instructions:** `../../CLAUDE.md` (project instructions)
- **System architecture:** `../../ARCHITECTURE.md` (data flow, deployment)
- **DBAL-specific:** `../shared/docs/` (implementation guides)
- **Phase 2 (TypeScript):** `../shared/docs/PHASE2_IMPLEMENTATION.md`
- **Phase 3 (C++):** `../production/docs/PHASE3_DAEMON.md`
