# TODO 1 - Workflows and SDLC automation

- [ ] Review `.github/prompts/` guidance and update or add prompts to match current workflows.
- [ ] Run `npm run act:diagnose` and `npm run act` to validate local GitHub Actions testing as documented.
- [ ] Verify Copilot workflows (`planning.yml`, `development.yml`, `deployment.yml`, etc.) align with `.github/COPILOT_SDLC_SUMMARY.md`; update workflows or docs when mismatched.
- [ ] Confirm PR/issue auto-labeling and auto-merge rules behave as documented; adjust configuration if gaps appear.
