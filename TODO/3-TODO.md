# TODO 3 - Testing, quality metrics, and documentation

- [ ] Expand unit and integration tests using `it.each` parameterized patterns; target >80% coverage per testing docs.
- [ ] Add/expand JSDoc for new or updated APIs and run `npm run check-jsdoc-coverage`.
- [ ] Update feature docs in `docs/architecture/` (why, data-flow diagrams, permission requirements) and update `docs/INDEX.md` or `docs/NAVIGATION.md`.
- [ ] Ensure package docs exist (`tests/README.md`, `static_content/examples.json`, `seed/metadata.json`) when adding or changing packages.
- [ ] Ensure the quality-metrics workflow and its scripts produce the documented reports and enforce thresholds (including size/complexity limits).
- [ ] Evaluate future enhancements from the Copilot SDLC summary: a11y checks, visual regression tests, Lua linting, package validation, and metrics dashboard.
