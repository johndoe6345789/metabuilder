# Database Abstraction Layer (DBAL)

The Database Abstraction Layer provides type-safe database operations with built-in security and multi-tenancy support.

## Overview

DBAL consists of two implementations:
- **TypeScript**: Fast iteration for development
- **C++**: Production security, credential protection

Both implementations follow the same YAML schema contracts to guarantee parity.

## Key Documentation

See [../dbal/](../dbal/) for detailed DBAL documentation and implementation guides.
