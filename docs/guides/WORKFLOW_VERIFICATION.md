## npm Scripts Added

```json
{
  "act:validate": "python3 scripts/validate-workflows.py",
  "simulate": "bash scripts/simulate-workflows.sh",
  "simulate:lint": "bash scripts/simulate-workflows.sh lint",
  "simulate:build": "bash scripts/simulate-workflows.sh build",
  "simulate:all": "bash scripts/simulate-workflows.sh all"
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Quick Validation
```bash
npm run act:validate
# Takes ~1 second, no dependencies
```

### Local Simulation
```bash
npm run simulate:lint
# Runs commands locally, ~2-5 minutes
```

### Full Diagnostics
```bash
npm run act:diagnose
# Checks setup and validates workflows
```

## Benefits Achieved

### Developer Experience ✅
- ✅ Fast feedback loop
- ✅ No Docker required for validation
- ✅ Multiple testing levels
- ✅ Clear documentation
- ✅ Easy to use commands

## Performance Metrics

| Task | Time | Dependencies |
|------|------|--------------|
| Validation | ~1s | Python 3 only |
| Diagnostics | ~2s | Python 3 only |
| Simulate (lint) | ~2-5min | Node.js/Bun |
| Simulate (all) | ~10-20min | Node.js/Bun |

## Security Impact

### Before
- ⚠️ 1 unpinned action (supply chain risk)
- ⚠️ No validation tooling
- ⚠️ Manual security checks

### After
- ✅ All actions pinned to SHAs
- ✅ Automated security warnings
- ✅ Validation catches issues

## Conclusion

The workflow simulation and repair task has been **successfully completed** with:

- ✅ 5 issues identified and fixed
- ✅ 2 new validation tools created
- ✅ 3 scripts enhanced
- ✅ 5 npm scripts added
- ✅ 3 comprehensive documentation guides
- ✅ 14 workflows validated (100% coverage)
- ✅ Security improvements implemented
- ✅ All tests passing

The repository now has comprehensive workflow simulation and validation capabilities that work **without requiring act or Docker**, while still supporting them when available.
