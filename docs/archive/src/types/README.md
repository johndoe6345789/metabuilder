# Type Definitions

## Overview
TypeScript type definitions and interfaces for application-wide use.

## Location
[/src/types/](/src/types/)

## Purpose
Centralized location for TypeScript interfaces and type definitions used throughout the application.

## Common Patterns

### Type Organization
- Feature-specific types in their own files
- Reusable interfaces exported from type files
- Proper namespacing to avoid conflicts

### Generic Types
- Generic component props interfaces
- Data model types
- API response/request types
