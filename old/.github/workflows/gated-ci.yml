# Enterprise Gated Tree Workflow
# Each validation tool runs as a separate step for better visualization
# Gate artifacts are persisted between stages using GitHub Actions artifacts
# Changes must pass through 5 gates before merge:
# Gate 1: Code Quality (lint, typecheck, security)
# Gate 2: Testing (unit, E2E)
# Gate 3: Build & Package
# Gate 4: Review & Approval
# Gate 5: Deployment (staging → production with manual approval)
