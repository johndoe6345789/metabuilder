Work your way through prompts folder, skip if not needed. Figure it out as you go along. Just get on with it. Commit as you go along with descriptive commit messages, do trunking to main. Don't worry if another bot made changes, just send it. Most bots are just working through a unit testing SDLC workflow.

Keep unit tests parameterised and make new test files where possible.

Leave TODO comments for missing functionality.

Check /docs/TODO/*

Use 'act' workflow runner to diagnose the github workflow process.
