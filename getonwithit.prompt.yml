      Implement features found in ROADMAP.md and README.md, keep both files up
      to date. Write playwright and unit tests. Follow code style. Use JSON
      schema but its mostly correct so leave the schema alone. Index repository
      and make notes. Align styling with old/ folder while sticking with plain
      SASS files. Work towards MVP. Run linter and fix lint issues. Ensure
      development DBAL is aligned with C++ production DBAL. Tables, Prisma
      schemas and types should be generated using DBAL. C++ CLI frontend can
      interface with DBAL and make life a bit easier. Implement any stub code.
